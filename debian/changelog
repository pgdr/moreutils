moreutils (0.60) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New implementation of isutf8 by Julien Palard.
    - Noncharacters (ending with 0xFFFF and 0xFFFE) were considered
      invalid when encoded in utf8, according to the unicode standard
      they are valid: "However, they are not illegal in interchange, nor
      does their presence cause Unicode text to be ill-formed."
    - \xf4\xbf\xbf\xbf was considered valid UTF8, which is not: after
      0xF4 the following byte should be between 80 and 8F.
    - This implementation does not try to decode the stream, so it checks
      it faster.
    - Add --list option. Closes: #691330

    Thanks, StalkR

  * Moved to a git repository.
  * vidir: Applied patch from Stefan Fritsch (one part of #412176):
    - Check for control characters (especially newlines) in filenames
      and error out, since this can greatly confuse the editor or vidir.
    - If the source of a rename does not exist (and thus the rename will fail
      anyway), vidir should not move an existing target file to a tmpfile.
    - If a directory is renamed, vidir should take that into account when
      renaming files in this directory.
    - If a directory name is passed as name/ to vidir, vidir should not
      add second slash after the name.
  * vidir: Add support for unlinking directories. To recursivly delete
    a directory and its contents, pipe find to vidir, and delete the directory
    and its contents in the editor. Closes: #412176

    if this means printing dups. Not sure I like this behavior either, but
    it's consistent with the very useful behaviors of "and" and "not".
